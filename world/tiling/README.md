This package describes various tilings used by sprites in the game.
Given a list of sprites associated with some tile type,
a tiling tells us which sprite to select based on the neighbours.

For example, a tiling can select the corner sprite for a tile,
or the center sprite for a tile, depending on the neighbours.
