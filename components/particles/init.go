package particles

// a particle that bounces but is solid

// a particle that does not bounce but is alpha blended and not solid

// a particle that floats and is alpha blended (drifts in air, no gravity)

// And two draw modes

// 1> solid particle

// 2> alpha blended particle (has transparency, glowing, etc)

// And three physics modes

// 1> bounces, gravity

// 2> Does not bounce, stops on impact, gravity

// 3> "drifts" at fixed velocity, no gravity

// when you fire gun do "shell casing" particle coming out of player
// when you hit block, do "debris" particle, etc
// test a spark or type of glowing/alpha blended particle
// create a struct called "Emitter" which is just something that creates particles, we can throw in game
